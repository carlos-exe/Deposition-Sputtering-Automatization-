Automation and control of Magnetron Sputtering deposition process

Magnetron Sputtering is a crucial technique in thin film manufacturing, but because plasma is a non-linear and unstable system, precise control by the operator is necessary. The final film properties depend on the GLAD (Glancing Angle Deposition) parameters and the exposure time of the substrate to the plasma, causing the appearance of different structures. This is why the lack of automation requires the constant presence of the operator in the laboratory, who must manually adjust these parameters.
In response to this need, a work has been developed that seeks to implement a basic operational control of the equipment. Specifically, the detection of plasma in the device, shutter control, GLAD rotation and tilt, and time control of these parameters. A software has been implemented that, by means of artificial intelligence, monitors in real time the presence of plasma in the chamber and, depending on this, the parameters are varied. This allows the operator to choose the behavior of the GLAD and the shutter as a function of time, implementing motion algorithms, with the aim of broadening the horizon of research variables.
Thanks to this, the control of multiple parameters of the Magnetron Sputtering has been simplified and more elaborated motion sequences of the GLAD have been achieved, which allow to obtain structures that can be used in a wide range of applications.
